  schedulingOrchestration:
    - id: gang_scheduling
      description: "The platform must allow for the installation and successful operation of at least one gang scheduling solution that ensures all-or-nothing scheduling for distributed AI workloads (e.g. Kueue, Volcano, etc.) To be conformant, the vendor must demonstrate that their platform can successfully run at least one such solution."

    - id: cluster_autoscaling
      description: "If the platform provides a cluster autoscaler or an equivalent mechanism, it must be able to scale up/down node groups containing specific accelerator types based on pending pods requesting those accelerators."
      level: MUST
      status: "N/A"
      evidence:
        - ""
      notes: "DaoCloud Enterprise run Kubernetes on-premises and does not provide any cluster autoscaler like karpenter."
    - id: pod_autoscaling
      description: "If the platform supports the HorizontalPodAutoscaler, it must function correctly for pods utilizing accelerators. This includes the ability to scale these Pods based on custom metrics relevant to AI/ML workloads."

  observability:
    - id: accelerator_metrics
      description: "For supported accelerator types, the platform must allow for the installation and successful operation of at least one accelerator metrics solution that exposes fine-grained performance metrics via a standardized, machine-readable metrics endpoint. This must include a core set of metrics for per-accelerator utilization and memory usage. Additionally, other relevant metrics such as temperature, power draw, and interconnect bandwidth should be exposed if the underlying hardware or virtualization layer makes them available. The list of metrics should align with emerging standards, such as OpenTelemetry metrics, to ensure interoperability. The platform may provide a managed solution, but this is not required for conformance."

  security:
    - id: secure_accelerator_access
