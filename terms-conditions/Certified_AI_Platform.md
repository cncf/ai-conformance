# Certified Kubernetes AI Platform Conformance Program Terms and Conditions

Last updated: November 7, 2025

This document sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to the Kubernetes AI Platform Conformance Program and the use of the associated Certified Kubernetes AI Platform Marks. 

## 1. Introduction and Scope

The Licensed Marks are trademarks of the Linux Foundation or a Linux Foundation project hosting entity. The Linux Foundation, through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ("CNCF"), has established this Conformance Program to standardize interoperability and portability for AI workloads running on Kubernetes. Hereinafter, the term “Licensor” will be used to refer collectively to CNCF, the Linux Foundation, and any Linux Foundation hosting entity that owns any of the Licensed Marks.

To ensure that the Licensed Marks remain reliable indicators of scalability and interoperability, Licensor permits use of the Licensed Marks by third parties only as Participants in this Conformance Program. By participating, a Participant acknowledges that third parties will rely on the accuracy of its submitted Conformance Checklist, submitted evidence of conformance, and compliance with these Terms.

By submitting one or more Applicant Platforms to be certified as a Conformant Platform, the Participant accepts and agrees to these Terms.

## 3. Incorporated Documents

The following documents, each as updated from time to time, are incorporated into and made a part of these Terms as if fully set forth herein:
* The Brand Guidelines;
* The Program Materials, including the Conformance Checklist Template; and
* The LF Trademark Usage Guidelines.

## 4. Enrollment, Eligibility, and Conformance Certification Process

**4.1 Payment of Fees:** To participate in the Program and submit Platforms for certification as Conformant Platforms, the Participant must pay any required participation fees. No fees are charged to either CNCF projects or to CNCF members in good standing.

**4.2 Platform Eligibility:** In order for a Platform to be eligible for certification, it must be publicly available and have public documentation accessible that is sufficiently comprehensive to enable an engineer to set up, configure, and deploy such Platform. 

**4.3 Submission:** A Participant confirms that its Applicant Platform version meets the Conformance Program requirements by submitting a complete and accurate Conformance Checklist with verifiable evidence. The submission must be made via a pull request to the Program Repository as described in the Submission Instructions, and must clearly identify the Applicant Platform with specificity, including its version number (if applicable). 

**4.4 Approval:** CNCF’s merging a Conformance Checklist pull request for an Applicant Platform signifies CNCF’s approval of such Platform as a certified Conformant Platform. The Licensed Marks may **only** be used with versions of Conformant Platforms whose Conformance Checklist pull request has been approved and merged by CNCF.

**4.5 Public Record:** The merged Conformance Checklist will be publicly available in the Program Repository.

**4.6 Scope of Certification:** Certification as a Conformant Platform and permission to use the Licensed Marks apply to a *specific version* of a Conformant Platform.

## 5. Maintaining Conformance

**5.1 Certification Period and Re-certification:** Certification of a Conformant Platform is valid for **one year** from the date the Conformance Checklist pull request is merged. To maintain certification for a Platform, a Participant must submit the Platform for re-certification annually by submitting a new or updated Conformance Checklist that is approved and merged by CNCF *before* the previous certification expires.

**5.2 Non-Conformance:** If CNCF discovers or determines that a Platform previously certified as a Conformant Platform fails to meet the claimed criteria, or that the submitted evidence of conformance is inaccessible, incomplete, or inaccurate, within 30 days of written notice, the Participant must correct such deficiencies to CNCF’s reasonable satisfaction; otherwise, the Platform’s certification status will automatically be revoked.

**5.3 Effect of Non-Conformance or Expiration:** In the event that the certification of a Platform is revoked or terminates for any reason (including, without limitation, failure to re-certify prior to expiration as described in Section 5.1, or uncured deficiency described in Section 5.2) the license granted hereunder to use the Licensed Marks with that Platform shall immediately terminate, and Participant must immediately cease use and display of the Licensed Marks with that Platform. Thereafter, in order to be eligible to use the Licensed Marks again, the Platform must re-apply for and achieve certification as a Conformant Platform.

**5.4 New Versions and Material Modifications:** If a Participant modifies a Conformant Platform in a way that is likely to materially affect its adherence to conformance criteria, or releases a new version of the Conformant Platform, the new or modified version will be considered a separate Platform for purposes of the Conformance Program and must be separately certified in order to qualify as a Conformant Platform.

## 6. Use of the Licensed Marks

**6.1. License Grant and Permitted Use:** Licensor grants to Participants who have satisfied the requirements of the Conformance Program a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use the Licensed Marks solely in connection with specific versions of Conformant Platforms whose submitted Conformance Checklist has been approved and merged by CNCF, for the certification period described in Section 5.1. All use of the Licensed Marks must comply with these Terms, the LF Trademark Usage Guidelines, and the Brand Guidelines. No other rights to use the Licensed Marks are permitted hereunder, except to the extent permitted under "fair use" or other applicable law.

**6.2 Usage Requirements:**

* **Do** follow the requirements set forth in the Brand Guidelines when using the Licensed Marks.
* **Do** specify the version of the Platform for which conformance has been achieved, in a location near the Participant’s use of the Licensed Marks.
* **Do** include appropriate notices of Licensor’s ownership of the Licensed Marks.

**6.3 Usage Restrictions:**
* **Do not** use the Licensed Marks except as permitted by these terms and conditions.
* **Do not** use the Licensed Marks with a Platform version that is not itself a Conformant Platform, or whose certification period has expired.
* **Do not** be misleading about the nature or scope of conformance.
* **Do not** state or imply that the Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program constitutes The Linux Foundation’s or CNCF’s endorsement of the Participant or its goods or services.
    * *Example:* do not say that a Participant or a Conformant Platform has been "certified by CNCF" or "certified by The Linux Foundation," or that "The Linux Foundation or CNCF has certified Product XYZ."
    * *Instead:* State that the platform version has achieved Kubernetes AI Platform Conformance.
* **Do not** state or imply that there are different degrees of conformance beyond what the program defines. For example, do not say that a Conformant Platform is "more scalable" than another simply based on conformance status.

**6.4 Ownership:** Participant acknowledges that Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in the Licensed Marks, including all derivations and associated goodwill. All goodwill from Participant’s use of the Marks shall inure to Licensor’s sole benefit. Participant shall not challenge Licensor’s ownership or act inconsistently with it. Participant shall not adopt, use, or register in any country any corporate name, trademark, domain name, or other designation that is confusingly similar to or dilutes the Licensed Marks. If Participant acquires any rights, registrations, or applications for the Marks, Participant shall immediately assign them, with all associated goodwill, to Licensor.

**6.5 Updates to Licensed Marks:** The Licensed Marks are subject to amendment from time to time by Licensor in its sole discretion. In the event Licensor terminates any of the Licensed Marks, Licensor may, in its sole discretion, replace any such terminated mark with a substitute mark. In the event Licensor modifies or terminates any of the Licensed Marks, Participant shall comply with any such modification and cease all use of any terminated mark as soon as practicable.

## 7. License to Participant Marks

Each Participant hereby grants to Licensor a royalty-free, worldwide license to use and display the names and logos of Participant and its Conformant Platforms (the "Participant Marks") in connection with Licensor’s operation of the Conformance Program and its marketing and promotion of Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program. 

Each Participant represents and warrants that it possesses all rights necessary to make this license grant. Licensor will comply with any reasonable requirements regarding use of the Participant Marks about which the Participant notifies Licensor, and will correct any identified misuse within a reasonable time following Participant’s notification. Nothing in this section shall require Licensor to make any use of the Participant Marks. As between Licensor and Participant, any goodwill associated with the foregoing use of the Participant Marks shall inure to the benefit of the Participant.

## 8. Term and Termination

**8.1 Term:** The term of a Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program shall begin the first time CNCF approves and merges a Conformance Checklist pull request submitted by the Participant. The term of the certification period for a particular Conformant Platform is described in Section 5.1. 

**8.2 Termination:** Either Licensor or the Participant may terminate Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program upon written notice to the other. Additionally, Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program shall automatically terminate (unless otherwise agreed by Licensor in writing) (a) upon the Participant’s breach of these Terms, if such breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 15 days thereafter; or (b) the expiration of the certification period for all of the Participant’s Conformant Platforms.

**8.3 Effect of Termination:** Upon the termination of Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program, the licenses granted hereunder to use the Licensed Marks shall immediately terminate, and Participant must promptly cease using the Licensed Marks and remove them from Participant’s marketing materials and websites. 

**8.4 Survival:** The sections of this agreement entitled "Ownership", "License to Participant Marks," "Disclaimer of Warranties," "Limitation of Liability," "Indemnification" and "Miscellaneous" shall survive termination of Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

LICENSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE CONFORMANCE PROGRAM, THE LICENSED MARKS, EITHER TO PARTICIPANT OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE DISCLAIMERS AND INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THE LF TRADEMARK USAGE GUIDELINES ARE ALSO DEEMED TO BE INCORPORATED HEREIN. A PARTICIPANT’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONFORMANCE PROGRAM DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY FORM OF ENDORSEMENT BY LICENSOR OF ANY PARTICIPANT OR ITS APPLICANT PLATFORMS OR CONFORMANT PLATFORMS, AND LICENSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT THERETO. THE CONFORMANCE PROGRAM IS OFFERED "AS-IS", "AS-AVAILABLE" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS."

## 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE CONFORMANCE PROGRAM OR ANY PARTICIPANT’S PARTICIPATION THEREIN. IF ANY DAMAGES ARE NOT EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW PURSUANT TO THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, THEN IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR’S LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES EXCEED THE FEES PAID TO LICENSOR BY THE PARTICIPANT SOLELY FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE CONFORMANCE PROGRAM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF LICENSOR’S DECISION TO OFFER THE CONFORMANCE PROGRAM AND THE PARTICIPANT’S PARTICIPATION THEREIN, AND SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UPON WHICH DAMAGES MAY BE CLAIMED; REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CAUSE ANY REMEDY TO FAIL IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

## 11. Indemnification

By electing to participate in the Conformance Program or to make any use of the Licensed Marks, each Participant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor, together with its affiliates and its and their respective employees, officers and directors (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages and penalties, and all related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from (a) the Participant’s breach of these Terms, (b) any third party claims that may arise in any manner by reason of Participant’s use of the Licensed Marks, and (c) any third-party claim relating to the Participant’s Platforms or the Participant’s other goods and services, including without limitation any product liability claim.

## 12. Entire Agreement; Modifications

These Terms, including the other documents incorporated herein, which are made a part hereof as if fully set forth herein, constitute the entire agreement between any Participant and Licensor regarding Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program. These Terms, including the documents incorporated herein, may be modified from time to time by Licensor, and updated versions will be placed in the Program Repository. Participant’s continued participation in the Conformance Program or continued use of the Licensed Marks constitutes Participant’s acceptance of all such modifications.

## 13. Miscellaneous

All notices to be sent to Licensor hereunder should be sent to conformance@cncf.io, unless otherwise specified herein. These Terms are governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to its choice of law provisions, and any action arising hereunder shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware. The Participant and Licensor agree that the Conformance Program does not create a partnership or joint venture between them or any other Participant.
